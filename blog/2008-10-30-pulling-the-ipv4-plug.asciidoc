Just as a little experiment tonight I disabled my IPv4 stack on Vista and went entirely IPv6 native (no tunneling). Of course I got what I expected, a completly unusable system.

*What worked:*

* Windows domain and Exchange - Thanks to recent upgrade of our company to Server 2008 and Exchange 2007 everything worked internally. File sharing, DNS, authentication...all worked like a charm.
* ipv6.google.com - Loaded right up and I was able to search. Also if you edit your host file and add a record for mail.google.com pointing to 2001:4860:0:2001::68 (at least for right now) you can access Gmail. I'm pretty sure that this works for MAPS and DOCS. Doesn't work for TALK however.
* www.arin.net - For all your IPv4/IPv6 needs...at least until they run out.
* www.kame.net - Love to see that turtle dance.

*What didn't work:*

* Basically everything else.

If IPv4 is going to run out in 2-3 years, the content providers have a long way to go.
