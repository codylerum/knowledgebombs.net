For those interested in the experiences of people that have been deploying and operating in an IPv6 world for quite some time, http://www.ripe.net/[RIPE^] has posted a few interviews with 'net savvy folks on their http://www.youtube.com/user/RIPENCC[YouTube channel^], with promises of more to come.

For those of you having a difficult time convincing your boss that IPv4 exhaustion is real and is something to be prepared for, RIPE has cross-posted the videos on an IPv6 advocacy and information site, http://www.ipv6actnow.org/[http://www.ipv6actnow.org^]. To emphasize the urgency, http://ipv6.he.net/statistics/[Hurricane Electric's IPv6 countdown^] could serve as an excellent visual aid:
