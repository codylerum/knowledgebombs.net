Netflix appears to be the first content provider to publish anything worthwhile to the IPv6 side of the Internet.

Netflix members can now manage their rental queues and stream content over IPv6.

If you're one of the few IPv6 enabled users out there, point your browser to http://ipv6.netflix.com[ipv6.netflix.com^] and give it a spin.
