p. For those interested in the experiences of people that have been deploying and operating in an IPv6 world for quite some time, "RIPE":http://www.ripe.net/ has posted a few interviews with 'net savvy folks on their "YouTube channel":http://www.youtube.com/user/RIPENCC, with promises of more to come.

p. For those of you having a difficult time convincing your boss that IPv4 exhaustion is real and is something to be prepared for, RIPE has cross-posted the videos on an IPv6 advocacy and information site, "http://www.ipv6actnow.org":http://www.ipv6actnow.org/. To emphasize the urgency, "Hurricane Electric's IPv6 countdown":http://ipv6.he.net/statistics/ could serve as an excellent visual aid:
