p. If you didn't notice, Ubuntu 8.10 was released today. As usual the mirrors and torrents were flooded with eager downloaders.

p. Canonical was nice enough to setup an IPv6 only tracker ("http://ipv6.torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/":http://ipv6.torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/)

p. Unfortunately it looks like only 27 downloads have completed in the 12+ hours it's been released.

p. It's a start, but when the first response to any networking problem on the support forum is to "DISABLE IPv6" I tend to think we have a long road left to travel.
